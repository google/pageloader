PageLoader
==========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/google/pageloader.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/google/pageloader)

A framework for creating page objects for in-browser tests or Webdriver tests.

Starting with version 3.0.0, PageLoader is changed significantly from version
2.X.X.

A strongly typed implementation of PageLoader for Dart. Does not rely on
dart:mirrors, which is slated for removal in Dart 2.0. If you're starting fresh with
Dart UI testing, we recommend you use PageLoader version 3.X.X. PageLoader version 2.X.X
and below is deprecated and no longer supported.

Migration guide will be added shortly.

If you are looking for the legacy version of PageLoader (with mirrors), refer
to the branch "2-stable" which is in sync with version 2.2.7.
